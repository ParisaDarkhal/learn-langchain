1.0 Physical Standards for Letters
1.1 Dimensional Standards for Letters

Letter-size mail is the following:

a. Not less than 5 inches long, 3-1/2 inches high, and 0.007-inch thick. For 
pieces more than 6 inches long or 4-1/4 inches high, the minimum thickness 
is 0.009. (Pieces not meeting the 0.009 thickness are subject to a 
nonmachinable surcharge under 1.2f.) 

b. Not more than 11-1/2 inches long, or more than 6-1/8 inches high, or more 
than 1/4-inch thick.

c. Not more than 3.5 ounces. (Charge flat-size prices for First-Class Mail 
letter-size pieces over 3.5 ounces.)

d. Rectangular, with four square corners and parallel opposite sides. 
Letter-size, card-type mailpieces made of cardstock may have finished 
corners that do not exceed a radius of 0.125 inch (1/8 inch). See 
Exhibit 201.1.1.1.

1.2 Nonmachinable Criteria
A letter-size piece is nonmachinable if it has one or more of the following 
characteristics (see 601.1.1.2 to determine the length, height, top, and bottom of 
a mailpiece):

a. Has an aspect ratio (length divided by height) of less than 1.3 or more than 2.5.

b. Is polybagged, polywrapped, enclosed in any plastic material, or has an 
exterior surface made of a material that is not paper. Windows in envelopes 
made of paper do not make mailpieces nonmachinable. Attachments 
allowable under applicable eligibility standards do not make mailpieces 
nonmachinable. 

c. Has clasps, strings, buttons, or similar closure devices.

101.2.1
d. Contains items such as pens, pencils, keys, or coins that cause the 
thickness of the mailpiece to be uneven; or loose keys or coins or similar 
objects not affixed to the contents within the mailpiece. Loose items may 
cause a letter to be nonmailable when mailed in paper envelopes (see 
601.3.3).

e. Is too rigid (does not bend easily when subjected to a transport belt tension 
of 40 pounds around an 11-inch diameter turn).

f. Is less than 0.009 inches thick if the mailpiece is more than 6 inches long or 
4-1/4 inches high.

g. Has a delivery address parallel to the shorter dimension of the mailpiece.

h. Is a self-mailer that is not prepared according to 201.3.14.

i. Is a booklet that is not prepared according to 201.3.16.

2.0 Physical Standards for Flats
2.1 General Definition of Flat-Size Mail

Flat-size mail is the following:

a. More than 11-1/2 inches long, or more than 6-1/8 inches high, or more than 
1/4 inch thick, except as allowed for EDDM-Retail flats under 140. For 
general retail mailability, all pieces 1/4 inch thick or less must be a minimum 
of 5 inches long and 3-1/2 inches high and 0.007 inch thick.

b. Not more than 15 inches long, or more than 12 inches high, or more than 
3/4 inch thick.

c. Flexible (see 2.3).

d. Rectangular with four square corners or with finished corners that do not 
exceed a radius of 0.125 inch (1/8 inch). See Exhibit 201.1.1.1.

e. Uniformly thick (see 2.4).

f. Unwrapped, sleeved, wrapped, or enveloped. 

2.2 Length and Height of Flats
The length of a flat-size mailpiece is the longest dimension. The height is the 
dimension perpendicular to the length.

2.3 Minimum Flexibility Criteria for Flat-Size Pieces
Flat-size pieces must be flexible. Boxes—with or without hinges, gaps, or breaks 
that allow the piece to bend—are not flats. Tight envelopes or wrappers that are 
filled with one or more boxes are not flats. At the customer’s option, a customer 
may perform the following test on his or her mailpieces. When a postal employee 
observes a customer demonstrating that a flat-size piece is flexible according to 
these standards, the employee does not need to perform the test. Test flats as 
defined in 201.4.3.

101.3.3
2.4 Uniform Thickness
Flat-size mailpieces must be uniformly thick so that any bumps, protrusions, or 
other irregularities do not cause more than 1/4-inch variance in thickness. When 
determining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece 
(1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, 
exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this 
determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of 
more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be 
nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the 
mailpiece (see 601.3.3).

2.5 Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces 
Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are 
considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable 
parcel prices.

3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels
3.1 Processing Categories 

USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: 
machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel. These categories are based on 
the physical dimensions of the piece, regardless of the placement (orientation) of 
the delivery address on the piece. For additional information on machinable, 
irregular, and nonmachinable processing categories, see 201.7.0.

3.2 Maximum Weight and Size
[7-9-23] All parcels must be large enough to hold the required delivery address, 
return address, mailing labels, postage, barcode, endorsements, and other mail 
markings on the address side of the parcel. For mailability, all pieces 1/4 inch 
thick or less must be a minimum of 5 inches in length, 3-1/2 inches in height, and 
0.007 inch in thickness. No mailpiece may weigh more than 70 pounds. Except 
for USPS Ground Advantage – Retail, which may not measure more than 
130 inches in length and girth combined, no mailpiece may measure more than 
108 inches in length and girth combined. For parcels, length is the distance of 
the longest dimension and girth is the distance around the thickest part. Lower 
size or weight standards apply to mail addressed to some APOs and FPOs 
subject to 703.2.0 and 703.4.0 and for Department of State mail, subject to 
703.3.0. 

3.3 Two or More Packages
With the exception of USPS-produced Flat Rate Envelopes and Boxes, two or 
more packages may be mailed as a single parcel, if they are about the same size 
or shape, if they are securely wrapped or fastened together, and if they do not 
together exceed the weight or size limits.

and DPOs. Priority Mail Express items must be large enough to hold the required 
mailing labels and indicia on a single optical plane without bending or folding.

A card must be of uniform thickness and made of unfolded and uncreased paper 
or cardstock of approximately the quality and weight of a stamped card (i.e., a 
card available from USPS). A card must be formed either of one piece of paper or 
cardstock or of two pieces of paper permanently and uniformly bonded together. 
The stock used for a card may be of any color or surface that permits the legible 
printing of the address, postmark, and any required markings. 

6.2.5   Acceptable Attachments 
A card may bear an attachment that is the following:

interfere with any address element, postage, marking, or endorsement and do 
not impair the physical integrity of the card. 

6.2.8   Address Side of Cards
The address side of a card is the side bearing the delivery address and postage. 
The address side may be formatted to contain a message area. Cards that do 
not contain a message area on the address side are subject to the applicable 
standards for the price claimed. For the purposes of 6.2, miscellaneous graphics 
or printing, such as symbols, logos, or characters, that appear on the address 
side of cards not containing a message area are generally acceptable provided 
the items are not intended to convey a message. 

6.2.9   Double Cards
A double card (a double stamped card or double postcard) consists of two 
attached cards, one of which is designed to be detached by the recipient and 
returned by mail as a single card. Double cards are subject to these standards:

101.6.2.10
a. The reply half of a double card must be used for reply only and may not be 
used to convey a message to the original addressee or to send statements 
of account. The reply half may be formatted for response purposes (e.g., 
contain blocks for completion by the addressee).

b. A double card must be folded before mailing and prepared so that the 
address on the reply half is on the inside when the double card is originally 
mailed. The address side of the reply half may be prepared as Business 
Reply Mail, Courtesy Reply Mail, meter reply mail, or as a USPS Returns 
service label.

c. Plain stickers, seals, or a single wire stitch (staple) may be used to fasten the 
open edge at the top or bottom once the card is folded if affixed so that the 
inner surfaces of the cards can be readily examined. Fasteners must be 
affixed according to the applicable preparation requirements for the price 
claimed. Any sealing on the left and right sides of the cards, no matter the 
sealing process used, is not permitted.

d. The first half of a double card must be detached when the reply half is 
mailed for return.
